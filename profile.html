        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            My name is Aidan Brus and I am a recent college grad trying to figure out what I'm doing. I finished my degree in
            applied math with a minor in physics from Montana State Univesity. Unsurprisingly, I really enjoy math and how you
            can use math to solve problems. I find a varieties topics and problems about space, finance, and many other math 
            related topics super interesting. So why is the page about F1? Well, for a couple of reasons. First, math and 
            analysis is a very important part of F1. Second, well, I just enjoy F1. Watching and keeping up with F1 is a 
            hobby of mine. Regardless, this page is largely fueled by my interest in F1 but it also gave me the chance to
            learn some new things and skills.
            <!-- I should probably have a picture of myself here to the right side of the personal paragraph-->
        </p>
        <h2>Why Did I make this Page or Models?</h2>
        <p>
            As a recent university grad trying to figure out what to do, I decided I
            should continue to learn new, relevant skills. As a math major, I spent more time doing work with pen and paper, which 
            I do enjoy but many professional careers now lean towards coding and AI. 
            Now I did learn some python and matlab during my
            educational career, but I would say that I was still a beginner. So, I decided that a good project for me would be to 
            learn something related to AI and neural nets. Yes, I know everything is AI-this or AI-that, but for the sake of being
            an attractive job canidate, you have to evolve with the market. The original plan was to make some models using pytorch,
            the python library, to make some simple models to predict something. I chose pytorch as I do have over 5 years experience
            in python so I could focus more on the models than just learning basics python. Following the advice that it is often easier to 
            make a project on a topic that you are already interested in, which led me to a few topics. After some brainstorming 
            and rough planning, I decided on an F1 related project. This decision was also influenced by seeing that there was an
            existing data repository for a variety of F1 information, FastF1.
        </p> 
        <p>
            Going with F1, first idea I got was to predict race results. No, not for gambling purposes, rather because I thought 
            it would be interesting. So I started working on building a simple model to predict race results. As I was finishing 
            my first model, I started to contemplate the idea of making a website for these models. Many job applications have a 
            place for personal websites links, and if I made a website for the models, I could also tack on a little bio page to 
            talk about myself. Two birds, one stone; I would a have a tangible coding project and a website that I built with a 
            personal bio. So, after I finished my first model, and almost finished my second model, I started working on this website.
        </p>
        <p>
            Does this put me on the AI, coding bandwagon? Probably. However, sometimes you have to play what is popular to keeping
            a fighting chance in this job market. Not that AI isn't inherintly interesting and math driven, but everything nowadays
            is AI-this or AI-that. Its super helpful but I also feel like you lose a lot of learning opportunites if you use
            it too much.
        </p>
        <p>
            Looking at everything that F1 has, there is a variety of different topics I could look into. 
            Beyond just predicting race outcomes, like finishing order or optimal tire strategy, there are engineering 
            and physics problems I could try modeling. I'll likely stick with "simpler" models first, models that do 
            simple predictions; however, designing something like a front wing sounds very interesting but would 
            require much more thorough modeling with a way to simulate testing. Given everything F1 has, I feel like there 
            is plenty of interesting topics I could easily get into. I do think however that the main driving force of 
            this page, if any, will be race predictions so I will focus on those first. 
        
        </p>
        <h2>What do I hope to get from all of this?</h2>
        <p>
            Directly, nothing. I don't expect to make anything from this website. I made this website as a testament to my
            ability to learn, adapt, and evolve my abilities. I know this website isn't the nicest or slickest or best website
            ever, but that isn't the point. I do enjoy coding, and many applications of math can be best explored and
            understanded through coding, but if I want to code all the time, I wouldv'e gone into comp sci or something similar.
            This website, for me, stands more as an example of my ability and want to continue to learn and grow. The plan is to
            continually improve this website both in performance and design while also dive deeper into neural nets, AI, and the
            like. This whole project has been an opportunity for me to dive deeper into topics I already know so that I can deepen 
            my knowledge and ability, but also expand the those very same things. I haven't figured out everything yet; hopefully, 
            this website helps me find an exciting path to follow.
        </p>
        <h2>Future Plans</h2>
        <p>
            I want to do some other models, like optimal tire strategies and maybe even try to design car components.
            Although optimial tire strategy isn't super interesting to most, I think it will be another somewhat simple 
            model to implement. I could also start doing driver championship predictions and team championship predictions
            which could be interesting, depending on the year. If we end up with a performance like 2023 Max, any predictions
            won't be very interesting, but even this year the two McLaren drivers remain close. I also suppose you could see
            how the rest of the grid will finish but usually who finishes first is the most interesting outcome.
        </p>
        <p>
            Writing this out has started getting me thinking about designing car components. Given I am not an ME, design
            might not be my strong suit, but the math behind optimizing their design would be. Without even looking at 
            equations, I assume its a lot of differential equations that are optimized to shape the designs of the pieces
            while FIA regulation likely places limits on these functions for what the optimial design can be. I think once 
            I have a couple different models up and running, maybe a couple more models for race outcomes and maybe two 
            models for optimal tire strategy, I may start designing a front wing or something.
        </p>
        <h2>Biggest Take Aways</h2>
        <h3>Python, Pytorch, Models</h3>
        <p>
            As of right now, the biggest take away from everything of done modeling wise is the biggest and most tedious part of 
            setting up a model is data aquistion, cleaning, and formatting. If I had actually kept track of how long it took me
            to just get the data ready to be used, it would greatly overshadow setting up the model and testing different models.
            Luckily, most of the data I use is from FastF1, which has a variety of functions that make getting data super easy.
            Some of the data I had to collect by hand, as I could find a consistent source to potentially scrap, which was tedious
            but worked. Once I got all the data into the notebook, the came formating the data. First I had to get the data from 
            the pandas data frame to a pytorch tensor, which isn't too bad. Then I had to ensure every value in the tensor was 
            a valid type, int or float and not a string or something else unhelpful. Again, not super painful, put still a bit 
            tedious. Then the bigger problem arose. Usually you train models on random subsets of your training data, but my
            training data couldn't be truly random. I couldn't mix qualifying results, data, or race results together because
            each driver performance is very correlated to the race, the drivers around them, and the other data from that specific
            track, that specific weekend, that specific year. 
            Futhermore, I had to keep races bundled together, as I couldn't mix qualifying data from
            race 2 with finishing data from race 12, it would remove any correlation between qualifying and race day. So became
            likely the most difficult part of the models, bundling races in the tensor to ensure that when a random race was
            chosen, all of the correct data was used to train that single time. Once that problem was solved, I ran into a couple 
            more problems with properly formatting the data, but after setting up my training data, most everything else fell into 
            place. I was unsure how difficult pytorch would be, it ended up being fairly simple, but getting the data ready to use 
            was far and away the more time consuming part of the models. I suppose I didn't even think about it at first, but 
            now I know better, that data takes some time before it can really be used.
        </p>
        <h3>The Website</h3>
        <p>
            Besides a couple formatting details here and there, html is pretty easy. Its akin to writing in word but you have to 
            declare what is a prargraph or header or so on. Sure the navbar took me awhile, but it wasn't because of the html 
            implementation. The worst part of html is I had to write all of the paragraphs, which isn't hard, its just like 
            writing a paper. Some of the code I've read uses div's instead of specific objects, like nav, and I am starting to 
            see why. Assigning object an id or class seems like it becomes super important especially for larger websites or 
            if there is a lot of unique animation or stylization. Once I move from creating the website, to improving and 
            polishing, I assume id and class will be very helpful.
        </p>
        <p>
            Css did give me a little harder of a time, but it still wasn't bad. Basic css is, well, basic. Declaring what font 
            or font color is fairly straight forward. Implementing more complex feature, on the other hand, took me a little
            longer. The navbar was the first big hurdle I had creating the website. I wanted a clean navbar that would stick
            on scroll. Getting the navbar on the page was so easy I then decided to add a hover animation to the navbar. So,
            I looked online at some example code, copied it over, and it didn't really work. So, I think after two days of messing 
            with navbar attributes, copying more code in, deleting other code, I finally had enough of an understanding of what 
            controlled what that I made a good enough guess to get the effect I wanted. Now, for the sticky navbar. Looking at
            other code, I thought I could implement the feature purely in css. Maybe, you can, but nothing I tried seemed to work.
            So, I finally had a reason to implement some Javascript. After getting the JS code write, and making sure names were 
            correct, and linking my JS script to every page, not 3 of the 4 pages, it worked mostly as intended. Had I started 
            with the JS code, it would've gone better, but lesson learned. Even though I had finally gotten a sticky navbar, I may
            screwed up the formatting trying in css, so I had to go back and amend my old code which now had problems. I fixed 
            most of them, and the one problem I still haven't fixed is now a feature, so its okay 
        </p>
        <h3>Javascript</h3>
        <p>
            My first real experience with it was for the navbar and I kinda cheated. I found some decent code online, slightly
            modified it to fit my code, and when it wasn't quite right, I may have asked some AI to check. I know, shame on me,
            but at that point I felt like I had spent far too much time on the navbar and really wanted to move onto something 
            else.
