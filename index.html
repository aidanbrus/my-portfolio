<!--This will become the new landing page, with animations-->
<!--current idea is to create a track as an animatable object so to have full control of it.
I can then animate into the track, hopefully bipassing needing to generate key frames.
It also might make "driving" down the track easier to animate. -->
<!--Need to make track item next that can be animated-->
